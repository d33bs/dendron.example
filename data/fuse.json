Monday.com is used as a project tracking source, Github is used as the primary source control vehicle. Project work may come in the form of internal continuous improvements, grant-related projects, or other needs CU Anschutz School of Medicine may have.\n\n## Challenge\n\nMonday.com is used as the primary means of work accounting and collaborations but is limited in it's ability to provide administrative visibility. This leads to manual work in creating reports, visualizations, and communications to others where an otherwise automatic solution could be used.\n\n## Porposed Solution(s)\n\n- Each arrow in the diagrams below is roughly equivalent to one \"workflow\" or ETL job which is either triggered or scheduled on a regular basis as needed.\n- \"Datastore\" as seen in the diagrams may be well-suited for object storage with query engine layered above it for utility in downstream deliveries.\n\n### Proposed Flow 1\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    monday[Monday.com\\nRaw Data] --> report[Aggregate\\nReport]\n    subgraph Generate\n        report --> storage[Datastore]\n    end\n    subgraph Deliver\n        storage --> PDF\n        PDF --> email\n        storage --> Slack[Slack Channel Post]\n        storage --> Teams[Teams Channel Post]\n    end\n```\n\n_Assumes data is usable or is not needed for archival from Monday.com source._\n\n- Report is generated from raw data and store in CHAI datastore.\n- Report is then sent as Slack, MS Teams posts.\n- Report is also stored in a PDF and sent in an email.\n\n### Proposed Flow 2\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    monday[Monday.com\\nRaw Data] --> storage[Datastore]\n    subgraph Generate\n        storage --> report[Aggregate\\nReport]\n        report --> storage\n    end\n    subgraph Deliver\n        storage --> PDF\n        PDF --> email\n        storage --> Slack[Slack Channel Post]\n        storage --> Teams[Teams Channel Post]\n    end\n```\n\n_Assumes data is not usable or is needed for archival from Monday.com source._\n\n- Monday.com raw data is stored in CHAI datastore.\n- Report is generated from raw data and store in CHAI datastore.\n- Report is then sent as Slack, MS Teams posts.\n- Report is also stored in a PDF and sent in an email.\n","n":0.054}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Onboarding","n":1}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"Dave","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Summary\n\nThis page is intended for use during onboarding procedures as a living reference of various items and access required by new or existing employees.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- [ ] Profile Headshot Picture\n- [ ] Professional Bio (3-5 sentences)\n- [ ] Team Introduction\n\n### Required Forms and Payroll\n\n- [ ] COVID Vaccination Status Form\n- [ ] Remote Work Agreement Form\n- [ ] Payroll Direct Deposit\n- [ ] IRS W-4\n- [ ] I9 Verification (Correspondence through email)\n\n### Benefits and Commuting\n\n- [ ] Benefits Enrollment / Benefits Orientation\n- [ ] RTD EcoPass\n- [ ] Parking\n\n### Required Trainings\n\n- [ ] New Employee Orientation (NEO) Course Completion\n- [ ] Training #1\n- [ ] Training #2\n- [ ] Training #3\n- [ ] Training #4\n- [ ] Training #5\n\n### General Access\n\n- [ ] Claiming Your Account\n- [ ] Email Address\n- [ ] Phone Communication\n- [ ] Duo Enrollment and Activation\n- [ ] LastPass\n- [ ] Google Workspace Account\n- [ ] VPN setup\n- [ ] Microsoft Teams Center for Health AI Team Access\n- [ ] Slack\n- [ ] Github Account (New or Linked)\n- [ ] Github Org for Center for Health AI\n- [ ] Monday.com\n- [ ] Zoom Account\n- [ ] University Badging\n\n### General Setup\n\n- [ ] Email Signature\n- [ ] Microsoft Profile Image\n- [ ] Slack Profile Image\n- [ ] Zoom Profile Image\n\n### Informational\n\n- [ ] Performance Planning and Reviews\n- [ ] Organization Chart\n- [ ] HR Business Partners\n- [ ] Branding Guidelines\n- [ ] School of Medicine (SOM) Information Services\n- [ ] CU Denver & Anschutz Office of Information Technology (OIT)\n- [ ] SOM Teams for Awareness\n- [ ] Purchasing Process\n- [ ] Grants\n- [ ] Task Sizing and Timing\n\n### Team Policies\n\n- [ ] Vacation Time\n- [ ] Sick Time\n- [ ] Communication\n- [ ] Seminar, Chalk Talk, Lunch+Learn Attendance\n- [ ] Generalized Source Control Cadence\n- [ ] Project Management Reporting\n\n### Team Assets\n\n- [ ] CHAI Website\n\n### Data Governance\n\n- [ ] HIPAA Data\n- [ ] FERPA Data\n- [ ] Data Source Approvals\n- [ ] Common CU Data Sources\n","n":0.055}}}]}
